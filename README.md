# My Personal Site
## What does this site use?
This site uses React.js and Gatsby as the main framework. Gatsby is a react-based framework tailored for creating static websites. Page styling is handled by SASS, a more consistent and managable way to produce CSS stylesheets
## Why is there no commit history? Who wrote the site?
This repo is a migrated version from a private repo that has about 20 commits. There are some blog posts in the commit history that I would not like to show (Nothing inappropriate, just childish when I look back more than 3 years later). I myself wrote the site, completely and alone.
## This is a website, but there is no link to access it?
The style and content of the webpage is outdated, which can give a false impression on my aesthetics. I am more proud of how the website is coded than how it looks. I am better at programming than designing. Nevertheless, I promise that the code works seamlessly.
